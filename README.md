Downloads and merges the tracker domains from [DuckDuckGo's blocklists](https://github.com/duckduckgo/tracker-blocklists). Currently this is too broad. DuckDuckGo has rules to deny or allow subpaths, which pi-hole can't do since it's DNS. This means while DDG may just block a tracking .js file but otherwise let a website load, blacklisting the website with Pi-Hole would block then entire website, which may prevent some things from working.
